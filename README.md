Retweet the tweets blood asking for blood requirement to blood banks/donors

If anyone asking for blood requirement urgently, they need to go to the concerned group asking for blood or ask the blood donor. 
What if the person doesnt have time / doesn't know who is the concerned donor or concerned group for it? 
For this we are developing a solution: 
When the person search for blood with a tweet, we can retweet the tweet asking for blood requirement to donors/blood bank.
